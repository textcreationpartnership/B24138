            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     </note>
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath resolved it so, in terms expresse. <hi>Apostolorum proprium erat,</hi> It properly appertained (saith he) to the <hi>Apostles</hi> to constitute Churches, and propagate the <hi>Gospell</hi> in those Churches wherein it never had been Preached. So farre unquestionably true, but what followeth after? <hi>Et hoc ad Romanum Pontificem pertinere, &amp; ratio &amp; experientia ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa nos docet,</hi> And that this doth belong to the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> both reason and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teach us. Belong it doth indeed to the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> so farre we dare joyn issue with him: but that it doth belong to the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and not to any other <hi>Bishops</hi> but by his sufferance and authority, which is the matter to be proved, that there is neither reason nor
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:197736:26"/> example for. No reason certainly, for if this did belong to all the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it did, then other Bishops which derive their pedegree from <hi>Andrew, James, John, Paul,</hi> or any other of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> have as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest herein as the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> who chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge their descent from <hi>Peter.</hi> And for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, if they go by that, they have a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate cause to manage.

                     <note n="n" place="margin">Ino Carnotens. in Chron. MS. citat. a Patr.

In agitation of which businesse, I observe these things. First, that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in so short a time was setled and confirmed over all the world, or so much of it at the least, as had received the Faith and Gospell. Secondly, that on all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent controversies, that did ingage the Church of Christ, the Bishops, as men most concerned in the Churches Peace, were still most forward also to compose the same. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that on the practises of the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> to enlarge their border, the Bishops of the Church of what part soever, have alwayes
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:197736:43"/> been most ready to oppose the same; and keep that proud and swelling <hi>See</hi> within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of its proper and peculiar bounds.

Fourthly, that on the rising of such differences, as did disturb the Churches Peace, the Bishops of the Church<note n="b" place="margin">Bellarm de Con. l. <hi>1.12.</hi>
                     </note> have an innate and proper power, of convocating and assembling <hi>Councels</hi> both <hi>Nationall</hi> and <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall</hi> for the appeasing of the same; wherein the greatest Champions of the Popedome, doe consent also: Which power as they made use of, as their own peculiar, when as there were no Christian Princes to have a care unto the maine: so since there have been Christian Princes, that power is not extinguished but directed onely. Fifthly, that in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels or Synodicall meetings, the Bishops and their Clergy had authority both to debate and to determine of all such matters, as did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> either in point of Faith or Ceremony; not seeking any confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their Acts and Ordinances, from that Christian people, who were to yeeld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to them. And last of all, that such
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:197736:44"/> things as by them were then determined, did presently oblige all people under the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and direction of the said Prelates and Clergy, so met together &amp; assembled, as before is said: as appears partly by that calme which followed over all the Church, upon the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Synods; but principally by that end, which afterwards was put unto this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, by the Councell of <hi>Nice.</hi>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:197736:46"/>
                     <hi>Eusebius,</hi> or any writer of his time. 2. It is not evident by the Authors words, that <gap reason="foreign">

Which certainly he did not, as his case then stood, without speciall reason. For being so vehemently opposed from his first election to the <hi>Episcopall</hi> office; all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities espied to draw away the peoples hearts and alienate their affections from him; every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage tooke against him during his absence from the City, to vexe and crosse him in his doings: what better way could he devise to secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the affections of the <hi>people,</hi> and the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his <hi>Presbyters,</hi> then to professe that in all his acts and enterprises whatsoever, he did and would depend upon the counsell of the one, and consent of the other.

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:197736:65"/> his own head, as we use to say, without the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of his <hi>Clergy</hi> and the consent of his <hi>People:</hi> and that on his returne, (for he was then in exile when he wrot this letter) he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his affaires with them, <hi>Et in commune tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctabimus,</hi> and manage them in common with their assistance. And certainly this was a prudent resolution, as the world went with him: For by this meanes he stood assured, that whatsoever <hi>Schisme</hi> or <hi>Faction</hi> should be raised against him, it would be never able to prevaile, or get ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as long as he had both the <hi>People</hi> and the <hi>Presbyters</hi> so obliged unto him, for the support of his authority. But this being but a private case, and grounded on particular reasons makes no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Rule: no <hi>Bishop</hi> being bound unto the like, by this example, but where all circumstances do concurre, which we meet with here; and then not bound neither, except he will himselfe, but as it doth conduce to his own security. So that it is to me a wonder, why the example of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> should be pressed so often, and all those passages so hotly urged, wherein the <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>People</hi> seeme to be concerned in matters of the <hi>Churches</hi> Government; as if both he and all other <hi>Bishops</hi> had been bound by the Law of God, not to do any thing at all in their holy function, but what the <hi>Presbyters</hi> should direct, and the <hi>People</hi> yeeld their suffrage and consent unto. For being but a resolution taken up by him, the better to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himselfe against his <hi>Adversaries;</hi> it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:197736:66"/> no man to the like, as before I said. And he himselfe did not conceive himselfe so obliged thereby, but that he could and did dispense with that resolution, as often as he thought it necessary, or but expedient so to do: performing many acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of importance, in the whole course and <hi>Series</hi> of his <hi>Episcopall</hi> Government, wherein he neither craved the advice of the one, nor the good liking of the other; and which is more, doing some things not only without their knowledg, but against their wils, as we shall make appeare in that which followeth. Now whereas the points of most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the Government and Administration of the <hi>Church,</hi> are the <hi>Election</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of <hi>Ministers,</hi> the <hi>Excommunicating</hi> of the <hi>Sinner,</hi> and the <hi>Reconciling</hi> of the <hi>Penitent:</hi> it will not be amisse to see, what and how much in each of these S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did permit, as occasion was, either unto the <hi>People</hi> or the <hi>Presbyters;</hi> and what he did in all and every one of these, as often as hee saw occasion also, without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and consent.</p>

And for the proofe of this, is urged a text from <hi>Moses</hi> in the book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> where God is said to speake thus to <hi>Moses,</hi>
                     <q>

                     </note> First, that the speciall power of judging of the worthinesse and unworthinesse of a man for the <hi>Prelacy,</hi> was in the brest of the <hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the speciall power of choosing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting to his place, according as they judged him worthy or unworthy, resided in the <hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that this power did descend upon the <hi>People, de Divina Autoritate,</hi> by Divine authority. These are the points collected from S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> words; which with the words themselves out of the which they are collected, are to be taken into consideration, because the waight of all this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doth rest upon them.</p>
                  <p>And first as for S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> words, there is no such command of God touching <hi>Eleazar,</hi> in any Bibles now remaining, as is there layed downe, which thing <hi>Pamelius</hi>

For whatsoever had been done in the <hi>Easterne</hi> Churches; the use was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and in the Churches of the <hi>West:</hi> in which it was so farre unusuall for lay-men to expound, or <hi>preach</hi> in the <hi>Bishops</hi> presence, that it was not lawfull for the <hi>Presbyters.</hi> For in the neighbour Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> it was thus of old, in these times at least.

For my part, I conceive it might be in both, both in the <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ex se,</hi> and the <hi>collocabant.</hi> For first the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of that Church had used to choose their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> from amongst themselves, <hi>Electing</hi> alwayes <hi>one</hi> of their own bodie.

And secondly, I take it that the course was altered, as to the <hi>Electors,</hi> to the <hi>Collocabant.</hi> For whereas heretofore the <hi>Presbyters</hi> had the sole power of the <hi>Election,</hi> to choose whom they listed, and having chosen to <hi>inthrone</hi> him without expecting what the <hi>People</hi> were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to do: the <hi>People</hi> seeing what was done in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, begun to put in for a share; not only ruling, but finally over-ruling the <hi>Election.</hi> What else should further the <hi>Election</hi> of these two
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:197736:89"/> I can hardly tell; but that their diligence and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduity in the discharge of the employment they had tooke upon them; the great abilities they shewed therein, and the great satisfaction gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thereby unto the <hi>People,</hi> who carefully fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented those publique <hi>Readings,</hi> had so endeered them to the multitude, that no other <hi>Bishops</hi> could content them, had not these been chosen. And this I am the rather induced to thinke, because that in a short time after, the interesse of the <hi>People</hi> in the <hi>Election</hi> of their <hi>Bishop</hi> was improved so high; that the want of their consent and suffrage was thought by <hi>Athanasius</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> Now in this businesse there are these two things to be considered; the man thus sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced, and those to whom the last part of the Sentence was to be put in execution: both of them yeelding matter worthy of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, for the present businesse. For <hi>Paulus</hi> first, the Fathers of the Councell laying downe the course and passages of his behaviour, do describe him thus:<note n="(u)" place="margin">Jd. ibid.</note> that being borne of meane and ordinary paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, hee had amassed great summmes of money, and full heapes of treasure: which hee had gotten by bribery and corruption, from those that were in <hi>Suites</hi> and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and had repaired to him to bee righted in their severall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: next, that hee never went abroad in publique, but that hee was attended by a guard; some of them going before him, others following after, to the great scandall of the Gospell: And last of all, that he had caused a <hi>Throne</hi> or <hi>Seate</hi> to bee erected for him, not such as did become one of CHRISTS Disciples, but high and lofty, such as the Princes of the world (or rather secular Princes) did use to sit in. Which passages (for I omit the rest that follow, as not conducing to the story which I have in hand) as they do manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly set forth unto us the extreame pride,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:197736:96"/> and base corruptions of the man: so doe they also give us no obscure light, whereby wee may discerne the customes of the Church in these particulars.</p>
                  <p>For first, I finde it not objected against <hi>Paulus,</hi> that hee did deale some times in such <hi>Suites</hi> and <hi>differences,</hi> (matters of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular businesse out of question) as were brought before him: but that hee tooke bribes,<note n="(x)" place="margin">Id. ibid.</note>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and received money of such men as came for <hi>Justice,</hi> and yet abused them too, and did nothing for them. So that it is not faulted by the Fathers, for ought I can see, that hee made himselfe a <hi>Judge</hi> amongst his brethren, or tooke upon him to compose such differences, as were brought before him (which certainely was no new matter in these times:) but that hee was corrupt and base, not <hi>Ministring,</hi> but <hi>selling Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> to the <hi>People;</hi> perhaps not selling <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> neither, but making them pay deerely for an unjust Sentence.</p>
                  <p>The next thing I observe is this, that <hi>Paulus</hi> is not charged by the <hi>Synod</hi> for being well attended, or having many followers waiting on him; according to the greatnesse of his place and quality. Their words a in <hi>Eusebius</hi> they are laid before mee, wills beare no such meaning: though some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,

                     <hi>quam eas autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas Romani Pontificis confirmasset,</hi> then as they were confirmed by the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as faine the <hi>Cardinall</hi> would have it. If so, what needed the <hi>Italian Bishops</hi> to be joyned with him? The <hi>Pope</hi> might do it of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe without their advise, indeed without the Emperours Authority. This was not then the matter, whatsoever was; and what was like to be the matter we have said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.

But there is something else to be considered, as to the matter of the reference to the point referred; as also to the persons who by this Soveraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority were inabled to determine in the cause proposed.</p>
                  <p>And first as for the point referred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there were two things considerable in the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:197736:98"/> whole proceedings against <hi>Paulus; viz.</hi> his dangerous and hereticall <hi>doctrine,</hi> and next his violent and unjust possession: the first had been adjudged before in the <hi>Councell,</hi> and he deposed for the same. With that the <hi>Bishops</hi> either of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> had no more to do, then to subscribe unto the judgement of the <hi>Synod:</hi> or being a matter meerely of spirituall <hi>cognizance,</hi> might in a like <hi>Synodicall</hi> meeting, without the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Authority as their case then stood, have censured and condemned the <hi>Heresie,</hi> though with his person possibly they could not medle, as being of another <hi>Patriarchas.</hi> But that which here I find referred unto them, was a meere <hi>Lay-fee,</hi> a point of <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> and <hi>possession,</hi> and it was left unto them to determine in it, whether the <hi>Plaintife</hi> or <hi>Defendant</hi> had the better right, to the house in question.

Out of which place and passage of my Author, there are these severall points to be considered, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to our present businesse. First; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding large revenue of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in these early daies; so great as to maintaine the numbers before specified, according to the ranke and qualitie of each particular; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of the which did ordinarily, and of
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:197736:104"/> common course belong unto the <hi>Bishop</hi> onely, or such to whom he pleased to entrust the same. And secondly we may observe the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie of succession, wherein the <hi>Bishop</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the other <hi>Clergie:</hi> he being but one, they many in their rancks and stations, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, sometimes fewer, according to the greatnesse of the Church, in which they ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the emergent necessities and occasions of it. Here in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to one onely <hi>Bishop,</hi> we finde a <hi>Clergie</hi> of inferior <hi>Ministers</hi> consisting of 154, Persons: which doubtlesse was exceedingly increased in the following times<note n="(e)" place="margin">Hierom in epist. ad Evagr.</note>

And last of all, wee may observe, that though <hi>Cornelius</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth <hi>Acolythites, Readers, Sub-Deacons, Exorcists</hi> and <hi>Sextens;</hi> these are not to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as distinct <hi>orders</hi> in the Church, although now so accounted in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but onely several services and imployments, which were required in the same.
